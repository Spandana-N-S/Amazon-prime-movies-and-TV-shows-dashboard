# Amazon-prime-movies-and-TV-shows-dashboard

Designed and developed a dynamic Amazon Prime Dashboard using Power BI, utilizing extensive Movies and TV show datasets spanning from 1930 to 2021. This comprehensive dashboard offers real-time insights into Amazon Prime's content library. Users can easily track key metrics, including show ratings, genre distribution, release-year trends, and country-specific content. By incorporating interactive visualizations and drill-down capabilities, the dashboard empowers decision-makers to make data-driven content acquisition and delivery strategies, enhancing the viewer experience and contributing to Amazon Prime's continued success.

This README file provides an overview of how I used Power BI and Kaggle datasets to create an interactive dashboard for Amazon Prime Video data.It contains comprehensive information about the content available on Amazon Prime Video, including details such as titles, genres, release years, ratings, and more. The project involves data extraction, transformation, and visualization to present insights into the Amazon Prime Video library.

Data Source:
kaggle dataset

Introduction The goal of this project was to utilize Power BI to create an interactive and insightful dashboard using the Amazon Prime Video dataset from Kaggle. The dashboard provides visual representations of various metrics and trends related to the Amazon Prime Video library.

Data Preparation Data Extraction:
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle as a CSV file.

Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Using Power BI, the dataset was imported and cleaned. Missing values were handled appropriately. Data types were corrected to ensure accurate analysis. Additional calculated columns were created to derive new metrics. Data Modeling:

Relationships between different tables (if any) were established. The data model was optimized for efficient querying and visualization. Dashboard Creation Importing Data into Power BI:

The cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI Desktop. Designing the Dashboard:

Visual elements such as charts, graphs, and tables were added to the dashboard. Filters and slicers were incorporated to enable interactive exploration of the data. Layout and design were optimized for a user-friendly experience.

Visualizations:

Bar Charts: Displayed the distribution of content across different genres. Line Graphs: Showed trends in content release over the years. Pie Charts: Illustrated the proportion of content by rating. Tables: Listed detailed information about the top-rated content. Features Interactive Filters: Users can filter the data based on various criteria such as genre, release year, and rating. Dynamic Visualizations: Visual elements update dynamically based on user interactions. Detailed Insights: Hovering over data points provides additional information and insights. Usage Opening the Dashboard:

Open the Power BI Desktop application. Load the Power BI file (.pbix) containing the dashboard. Interacting with the Dashboard:

Use filters and slicers to explore different aspects of the dataset. Hover over visual elements to view detailed insights. Click on data points to drill down into specific information.

Key Metrics and Visualizations:
 * Total Titles: Displays the total number of movies and TV shows available on Amazon Prime.
 * Total Ratings: Shows the number of unique ratings assigned to titles.
 * Total Genres: Lists the total number of distinct genres represented in the catalog.
 * Total Directors: Indicates the total number of directors with titles on the platform.
 * Start Date and End Date: Provides the earliest and latest release years of content available.
   
Visualizations:
 * Ratings by Total Shows: This bar chart illustrates the distribution of titles across different rating categories (e.g., 13+, 16+, etc.).
 * Genres by Total Shows: A bar chart displaying the top genres based on the number of titles.
 * Total Shows by Country: A world map with color-coded countries representing the number of titles originating from each region.
 * Movies and TV Shows: A pie chart showing the percentage breakdown of movies vs. TV shows.
 * Total Shows by Release Year: A line chart depicting the trend of title releases over time.

Conclusion This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to transform raw data into meaningful insights through interactive dashboards. By leveraging the Amazon Prime Video dataset from Kaggle, I was able to create a comprehensive visualization tool that provides valuable insights into the content library of Amazon Prime Video. The dashboard enables users to explore trends, distributions, and detailed information about the available content.
